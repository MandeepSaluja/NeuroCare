# NeuroCare: Self-Diagnosis and Therapy Platform

Overview:
NeuroCare is a revolutionary platform designed to assist users in diagnosing themselves with neurological conditions such as Epilepsy, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson’s Disease. Additionally, the platform offers the unique feature of one-to-one therapy sessions conducted by a Therapy Bot, providing users with personalized support from the comfort of their own space and at their preferred timings. Utilizing cutting-edge technologies including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Ensemble Modelling, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Flask, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), NeuroCare ensures accuracy, efficiency, and user-friendliness.

**Key Features:**

Self-Diagnosis Module: Users can input their symptoms and receive a preliminary assessment for neurological conditions such as Epilepsy, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson’s Disease. The platform employs advanced machine learning models trained on extensive datasets to provide accurate predictions.

Therapy Bot: Users have access to one-to-one therapy sessions facilitated by a Therapy Bot. This feature allows individuals to receive emotional support and guidance without the need to leave their homes or adhere to rigid schedules.

**Technologies Used:**

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Utilized for image processing and analysis, particularly in diagnosing neurological conditions based on medical images.
Ensemble Modelling: Combining multiple machine learning models to enhance accuracy and reliability in diagnosis.
Scikit-learn: A comprehensive machine learning library in Python used for predictive data analysis.
TensorFlow: An open-source machine learning framework developed by Google for building and training neural networks.
Flask: A lightweight web application framework in Python used for developing the backend of the platform.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Employed for analyzing and processing textual data, enabling the platform to understand user input and provide appropriate responses.
Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM): A type of recurrent neural network architecture used for processing and analyzing sequential data, such as time-series data or natural language sequences.
